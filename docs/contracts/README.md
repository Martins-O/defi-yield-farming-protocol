# YieldFarm Protocol - Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

YieldFarm Protocol is a sophisticated DeFi yield farming platform built with security, efficiency, and user experience at its core. Our smart contracts enable users to stake liquidity provider (LP) tokens and earn rewards through innovative farming mechanisms.

## Contract Architecture

```
YieldFarm Protocol
├── YieldFarm.sol (Main farming contract)
├── YieldToken.sol (Reward token)
└── MockLPToken.sol (Test LP token)
```

## Core Contracts

### YieldFarm.sol

The main farming contract that manages pools, stakes, and reward distribution.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-pool architecture with dynamic allocation points
- Bonus reward multipliers for early adopters
- Emergency withdrawal and pause functionality
- Anti-whale protection with stake limits
- Gas-optimized reward calculations

### YieldToken.sol

ERC-20 reward token with capped supply and minting controls.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed maximum supply of 1,000,000 tokens
- Owner-controlled minting
- OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation
- Deflationary tokenomics ready

### MockLPToken.sol

Development and testing LP token contract.

**Key Features:**
- Standard ERC-20 implementation
- Unlimited minting for testing
- Represents liquidity provider shares

## Security Features

### Reentrancy Protection
All state-changing functions are protected with OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.

### Access Controls
- `Ownable` pattern for administrative functions
- Role-based permissions for different operations
- Multi-signature compatibility

### Emergency Controls
- `Pausable` functionality for emergency stops
- Emergency withdrawal without rewards
- Time-locked critical parameter changes

### Anti-Whale Mechanisms
- Configurable minimum and maximum stake amounts per pool
- Whale detection and mitigation strategies
- Fair distribution algorithms

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Algorithms
- Batch operations for multiple actions
- Optimized storage patterns
- Minimal external calls

### Smart Batching
- Reward calculations cached and batched
- State updates minimized
- Gas cost amortization across users

## Pool Management

### Pool Configuration
```solidity
struct PoolInfo {
    IERC20 lpToken;        // LP token contract
    uint256 allocPoint;    // Reward allocation weight
    uint256 lastRewardBlock; // Last reward calculation block
    uint256 accTokenPerShare; // Accumulated rewards per share
    uint256 totalStaked;   // Total staked amount
    uint256 minStakeAmount; // Minimum stake per user
    uint256 maxStakeAmount; // Maximum stake per user
}
```

### Dynamic Allocation
- Real-time allocation point adjustments
- Community governance integration
- Automated rebalancing mechanisms

## Reward Distribution

### Formula
```
pendingReward = (userAmount * pool.accTokenPerShare) / 1e12 - user.rewardDebt
```

### Bonus Multipliers
- Early adopter bonuses (2x multiplier)
- Loyalty rewards for long-term stakers
- Dynamic multipliers based on market conditions

### Compound Interest
- Automatic reward reinvestment options
- Optimized compounding schedules
- Gas-efficient compound operations

## Integration Guide

### Basic Staking Flow
1. Approve LP tokens for the YieldFarm contract
2. Call `deposit(poolId, amount)` to stake tokens
3. Earn rewards automatically over time
4. Call `harvest(poolId)` to claim rewards
5. Call `withdraw(poolId, amount)` to unstake

### Advanced Features
- Batch operations for multiple pools
- Scheduled withdrawals
- Automated compounding

## Events

### Deposit
```solidity
event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 indexed pid, uint256 amount);
```

### Withdraw
```solidity
event Withdraw(address indexed user, uint256 indexed pid, uint256 amount);
```

### Harvest
```solidity
event RewardPaid(address indexed user, uint256 indexed pid, uint256 amount);
```

### Emergency
```solidity
event EmergencyWithdraw(address indexed user, uint256 indexed pid, uint256 amount);
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
- `"Insufficient balance"` - User doesn't have enough staked tokens
- `"Amount below minimum"` - Stake amount too small
- `"Amount exceeds maximum"` - Stake amount too large
- `"Pausable: paused"` - Contract is paused

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation during emergencies
- Partial operation modes
- Recovery procedures documented

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- 100% function coverage
- Edge case testing
- Stress testing with large numbers
- Gas usage optimization tests

### Test Scenarios
- Single user operations
- Multi-user concurrent operations
- Emergency scenarios
- Upgrade scenarios

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Foundry development environment
- Sufficient ETH for deployment gas
- Multi-signature wallet for ownership

### Deployment Script
```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast

2. Initialize pools and parameters
3. Transfer ownership to multi-sig
4. Enable emergency procedures
